# Newspaper Dissector
The *Newspaper Dissector* is visualisation software for categorising and visualising newspaper pages based on topic, word count and source.

An example of its use can be seen in the [Anatomy of a Newspaper blog series](http://mhbeals.com/anatomy-of-a-newspaper-the-caledonian-mercury-20-june-1825/)

It will be featured in an forthcoming article for *Victorian Periodicals Review*.
